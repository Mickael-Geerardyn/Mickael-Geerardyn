- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionnate about information technlologies and programmation
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to improve my skills in web development with PHP and his framework SYMFONY at the openclassrooms school. 
Actually, i learn it with the application developer PHP/SYMFONY course since June 2022.

I am following this training in parallel with my full time job as a consultant. About this job, i'm web integrator in a marketing team. I update the web pages by HTML/CSS and javascript/Jquery.

In the near future, I'll like to become web developper on back-end with PHP/SYMFONY with a full time job.

Here, you can find some projects about my job and my training.
